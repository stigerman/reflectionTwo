When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
To collaborate with Others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
There may be files you want to keep seperated by workflow. Local files you may not want updated with production code if you're tesing and have altered the codebase
